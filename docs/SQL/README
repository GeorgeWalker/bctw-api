The folder contains all the staging tables created from the text, CSV, and Excel spreadsheets
provided to use from the Ministry.

The main document of note is 'table_creation_vendor_data_merge.sql.' This TABLE CREATE statement is an attempt to unify
the three different vendor collar data into a single table. This table is based on the
January_2020_Monthly_Collar_Summary_20200220 document. It is essentially reverse engineering of the data contained in
that document as the process of collecting the data was not completely revealed to us by CASLYS.
